Step-0: Launch an EC2 instance in myvpc-1 public subnet & SSH into it

Step-1: Update all packages

sudo yum update -y

Step-2: Install all packages for Apache and PHP

sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y lamp-mariadb10.2-php7.2 php7.2
sudo yum install -y httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd

Step-3: Install MariaDB Database service

sudo yum install -y mariadb-server
sudo systemctl start mariadb
sudo systemctl enable mariadb

Step-4: Configure the Database

sudo mysql -u root
CREATE DATABASE wordpressdb;
create user wordpressadmin@'%' identified by 'wordpressadmin';
grant all privileges on wordpressdb.* to wordpressadmin@'%';
flush privileges;
exit
sudo service mariadb restart

Step-5: Download and place the Wordpress Code into Apache root directory along with the necessary permissions on wp-content sub-directory

sudo wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
sudo tar -xvf latest.tar.gz
sudo mv wordpress/* /var/www/html
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/wp-content/
sudo chown -R apache.apache /var/www/html/wp-content/

Step-6: Install Wordpress 
Note*** In this section we will also demonstrate nuance of Wordpress when it comes to Site URLs. 
Note*** We are intentionally using the public IP address to install the EC2 from the browser
Note*** This same exercise will be repeated later however with a Route-53 A type record resolving insights.apex.tld to an Elastic/Public IP bound to EC2.

As of now continue with the below configuration if you have NOT experienced the Wordpress site URL issue. DO NOT USE the below mentioned IP address method if you have already observed the Wordpress site URL issue. 

Browse to the Public IP of your EC2 instance & Let's go (If you have finished observing the SITE URL nuance issue and are redoing this lab, then browse the Route-53 URL in A type record)
Database name: wordpressdb
Database username: wordpressadmin
Database password: wordpressadmin
Database host: Public IP of your EC2 (In the case of distributed stack, this will be the private IP of DB instance)
Table prefix: Leave it at the default, i.e. wp_
And try to install

Step-7: wp-config.php configuration

wp-config.php is the wordpress configuration file 
It tells wordpress application of how to connect with the Database service
When we run the browser based install, the wordpress installer tries to build this file automatically from the values that you provided in step-6
It tries to build this wp-config file and write it into /var/www/html directory 
However, the apache webuser does not have any write permissions on the /var/www/html directory
Hence the web installer cannot create this file on its own & prompts you to create this file manually
Copy the PHP code contents from the text box on the browser
Please ensure that you copy only the PHP code (full code) in the text box.
SSH into EC2 instance and navigate to the apache root directory via cd /var/www/html
Assume root privileges "sudo su"
Create a new blank file called wp-config.php and paste the contents of the copied PHP code into this file

sudo su
cd /var/www/html
vi wp-config.php
Esc + I to insert
Copy the PHP contents from the splash screen of wordpress installer
Esc + : + wq! to save and extras
Execute a httpd restart by "service httpd restart"
Return back to the browser and continue the installation

Step-8: Finish your wordpress installation

Site Title: any title of your choice
Username: firstnamelastname
Password: firstnamelastname
Check on "Confirm use of weak password"
Enter your email address
Leave "Discourage search engines from indexing this site" as unchecked
Install

Step-9: View your Wordpress Dashboard & site

After installation you will arrive at your Wordpress login screen. Use the firstnamelastname as credentials
You will arrive at a Wordpress Dashboard that allows you to customize your website
On left hand top you will site the site title, click & then visit site
You will arrive at the homepage 
Scroll down and get a feel of your first live Wordpress hosted website
You can observe on the top right hand, that you are logged in as the adminstrator
If you want to get into dashboard mode, you can click back the site title "top left hand" and then click on dashboard

Step-10 Observe key files and folders on EC2

SSH into EC2 & cd /var/www/html
Observe that the wp-config.php occurs at /var/www/html level as narrated above
Another important directory is called as wp-content. 
This directory can be accessed as a read/write from the browser
Note the permissions that we had given to /var/www/html/wp-content/ earlier while downloading wordpress latest.tar.gz
Basically, this directory hosts three important sub-directories (themes, plugins, uploads)
Themes directory will store all themes that can be used by wordpress
Plugins directory will host any plugins, i.e. customized php codes that allows various additional for the default wordpress installation
Uploads directory will host all the media uploads done via the browser

Step-11: /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads directory

Navigate to cd /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads
Do a "ls" and you will observe this directory to be blank if this is a fresh., first time wordpress installation

Step-12: Create your first post

Browse and login into your wordpress website
The Wordpress platform has built-in functions of creating and maintaining posts/blogs
Click on + icon on the top ribbon
Add your first post and add a media "browse and upload an image". 
This image will be embedded into your post. 
Chase the blue button and publish the post.
Navigate to the homepage (top left hand > site title > visit site) & scroll down to see your published post
Feel free to create as many posts you want in a similar manner

Step-13: Let's correlate the media added and the /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads directory

When you added the media in the post, you uploaded the image file
This file gets uploaded to /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads directory
However, the uploads are stored in a certain method, i.e. a sub-directory routine YYYY/MM is automatically added within uploads directory
SSH into your EC2 instance and cd /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads 
Do a "ls' and observe the difference
You will notice that a sub-directory structure has been automatically created on first image upload
This will look like YYYY & then under YYYY you will find MM directory
You will notice that the media images that were attached to the posts have been uploaded to MM directory.

Step-14 Change the default theme

The Wordpress installation comes with a default theme
You can fancy up your site by changing the default theme
There are thousands of free and paid themes on the internet for wordpress based on your requirement
Some are Ecommerce themes, Blogging themes, etc...
Let's experiment with a paid theme called as Hestia
SSH into your EC2 instance & download a beautiful theme called as hestia

cd /var/www/html/wp-content/themes
sudo wget https://downloads.wordpress.org/theme/hestia.1.1.85.zip
sudo unzip hestia*
sudo ll

You will realize that all other files except hestia have their permissions & ownership with apache
The hestia files are owned by root as they were added new

Re-execute a permissions and ownership change on the entire wp-content directory

sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/wp-content/
sudo chown -R apache.apache /var/www/html/wp-content/

Now go to your wordpress website > login > dashboard > left hand menu > appearances > themes

You should see the newly added hestia theme featured
IMPORTANT: First Click on the blue button "Live Preview" and it will open up a preview
On the preview window, change the Text as per your preference 
Then on the left hand menu "Activate & Publish"

You can visit your site and see the new theme. You can further customize the theme by changing background image, etc..

Step-15 Make your site an Ecommerce application

Woocommerce is the most popular ecommerce plugin for Wordpress
SSH into your EC2 instance > sudo su > cd /var/www/html/wp-content/plugins

wget https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/woocommerce.3.4.4.zip
unzip woo*
chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/wp-content/
chown -R apache.apache /var/www/html/wp-content/

Go the website's dashboard > plugins > Activate Woocommerce plugin and on the top ribbon you will see a guided setup.. 
Follow the woocomerce setup and you can import a demo product database
Download this file into your laptop https://s3.amazonaws.com/labs.thecloudgarage.com/wordpress/data-example-1.csv
On the Woocommerce import utility., browse and upload this product catalogue and follow 
Once done, visit your home page and scroll down
You should be able to see your products listed
You can add images to these products if required
